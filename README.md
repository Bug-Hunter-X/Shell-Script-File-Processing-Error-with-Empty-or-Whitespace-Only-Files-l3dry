# Shell Script File Processing Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting related to file processing. The script attempts to read and process a file line by line, but it fails when the file is empty or contains only whitespace characters.  The issue stems from how the `read` command handles empty or whitespace-only lines.

## Bug Description
The `while` loop using `read` doesn't iterate when the file is empty or contains only whitespace. This leads to the script skipping file processing entirely under those conditions.  This is an edge case commonly missed in file processing.

## Solution
The solution involves a more robust check for empty or whitespace-only files and a better approach to handling the lines read from the file.
